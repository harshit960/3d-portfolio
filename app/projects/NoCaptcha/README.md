# 🔒 Enhancing Web Security with Advanced LLM Bot Prevention Techniques

Exploring innovative strategies to protect web services from LLM bot attacks while maintaining user experience.

---

## ❓ The Problem

LLM bots can perform various malicious activities, such as scraping data, automating interactions, and bypassing standard authentication mechanisms. These activities not only degrade user experience but can also compromise sensitive data and intellectual property.

---

## 💡 My Solution

To tackle these challenges, I developed a bot prevention system that balances security and user-friendliness. The architecture of the system is designed to provide layered verification while maintaining a seamless user experience.

### 🏗️ System Architecture

- **Target-Frontend:** Entry point for all user interactions.
- **User Agent Scan:** Scans user agents to detect malicious requests.
- **Backend-Main:** Core processing unit for routing and analysis.
- **Pub/Sub Queue:** Ensures efficient handling of high traffic.
- **IP Scan:** Analyzes IP patterns for suspicious activity.
- **Database:** Token-based approach to avoid storing sensitive data.

### 🔧 Flexible Restrictions

Unlike traditional systems that block LLM bots entirely, my system allows fine-grained control. This ensures no negative impact on SEO or overall website performance.

---

### 🤹 Dynamic Challenges

The system dynamically generates challenges based on the type of request and the user’s behavior, ensuring no single solution can be reused or exploited by bots.

---

### 🧠 Behavioral Analysis

Leveraging libraries like `rrweb` in React, I captured and analyzed real-time user interactions to distinguish bots from humans accurately.

---

### 🎯 User-Centric Design

The project emphasizes accessibility, mobile responsiveness, and minimal friction, ensuring genuine users can pass verification quickly.

---

## 🌟 Impact

By implementing this advanced LLM bot prevention system, the risk of bot attacks is significantly reduced, protecting user data and enhancing the overall security of web services.
